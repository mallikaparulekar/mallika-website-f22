I'm an Masters Student in Computer Science at Stanford University specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I'm broadly interested in applying machine learning to high-impact problems in learning, robotics and recommendation systems.

I completed my undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley in Computer Science. There, I was a research assistant at <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">BAIR</a> in Professor Goldberg's <a href="https://autolab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">AUTOLab</a> where I worked on problems in robot grasping and cable manipulation using analytic theory and deep learning. 
Previously, I worked on recommendation systems at  <a href="https://about.meta.com/" target="_blank">Meta</a>, backend and fullstack development at <a href="https://carohq.com/" target="_blank">Caro</a>, and anomaly detection at <a href="https://abacus.ai/" target="_blank">Abacus.AI</a>. As an avid enjoyer of discrete math and probability who loves teaching, I was also a TA for <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/" target="_blank">CS 70</a>.
